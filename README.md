# etch-a-sketch

Creating an etch-a-sketch using JavaScript and CSS.

I'll need to come back to refine this. 
But, for the moment, it's working how it's mostly supposed to.
I just need to add a way to limit the size of the width, so everything is an even box.
At the moment, when it's supposed to be 40 boxes wide and 40 boxes tall, it stretches,
across the full 1312px width I have set, instead of wrapping at the end of the first 40.
My guess, I'll have to do some inline-blocks, instead of using a flexbox with wrap.
